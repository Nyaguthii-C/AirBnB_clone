- By the end of the project, it will be complete web application composed by:

	 - &ensp; A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
	 - &emsp; A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
	 - &emsp; A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	 - &emsp; An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
